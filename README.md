While holding a button in the "Pads" section of notfound press a step on Step Seqence A or B, if you don't want the Pads to sound while selecting them toggle "Mute pads". To remove a step from a Seqence just press the step you wish to remove while not holding any pads.

Press any pad in sections A->J to play the corisponding pad on your 404, watch the voices stack up on the screen of your Norns. To remove a sounding pad press it again.

To toggle Pad holding press "Pad hold".
To toggle Voice stealing press "Voice stealing".
To send a off message to all pads press Silence all pads.

At this time founder is really simple and is missing chord memory, but I hope you still find it enjoyable.



End:
I hope these tools help you find new use for your 404, remember there are still new things to be found across the banks no matter how many times you have walked them before. 

and have fun :) -defbln
